# SurvivalOfTheUnfit

A simple sort-of-text-based survival game.

Currently lacks many planned features.

Planned features:
1. Tiled world map the player can traverse at the cost of food/hunger. Tiles have different biomes that affect actions in different ways.
2. Ability to claim one tile as your home, which can generate unique resources that are only available on that biome.
3. Random encounters that can happen when performing an action and/or moving on the worldmap. These are akin to the events you can find in Slay the Spire, Peglin, FTL, etc. that will reward/punish the player for making certain decisions.
4. Basic turn-based JRPG combat system.
5. Character equipment.

Features that will be added last if they're feasible to implement:
1. Online world map that is shared between all players.
2. Ability to set trading posts at your home which players can purchase items from each other.
